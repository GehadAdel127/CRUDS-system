# CRUD System Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) System** is a web application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The system allows users to easily manage a list of items, providing the ability to add, view, edit, and remove data in a simple, interactive interface.

### Key Features:
- **Create**: Users can add new items to the list via a form, allowing easy data entry.
- **Read**: All added items are displayed in a clean, organized list, enabling users to view their data.
- **Update**: Users can edit existing items by selecting them and updating the details in the form.
- **Delete**: Items can be removed from the list with a confirmation prompt to avoid accidental deletions.
- **Data Persistence**: Data is saved in the browser using **localStorage**, ensuring that changes persist even after a page reload.
  
### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content and layout of the application.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for a clean, responsive interface and interactive design elements.
- **JavaScript**: The core logic for handling data manipulation (creating, reading, updating, and deleting items) and dynamically updating the user interface.

### Purpose:
This CRUD system demonstrates how to build a simple, yet fully functional web application with just front-end technologies. It showcases practical use of JavaScript for data manipulation and local storage for data persistence. This system serves as an excellent foundation for understanding how CRUD operations work in web development.

### Future Enhancements:
- Implement backend integration for persistent data storage across different sessions.
- Add **search and filter functionality** to manage large sets of data.
- Implement **form validation** to ensure users provide correct input.
